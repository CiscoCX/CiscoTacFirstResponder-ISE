# CiscoTacFirstResponder-ISE

Cisco TAC First Responder script for ISE.

These hosted scripts streamline the generation and transmission of diagnositic data from a ISE deployment to Cisco TAC.

## Collect a DART on Windows

Work - in - Progress

````

## Collect on MAC

The script is written for zsh, the default shell for the `Terminal.app` (Since Mac OS Catalina). Have the user open the `Terminal.app` and then paste the following in (with the `cxdUsername` and `cxdToken` replaced with the values you received from the Cisco TAC Engineer).

The script will do the following:
    - Download and install a copy of python into the following director ~/.cisco_firstresponder
    - Setup a virtual environment for the python install and install the python dependencies
        - scrapli[asyncssh]
        - httpx
    - Download the script `mac_ise_collection.py` into the following directory ~/.cisco_firstresponder
    - Execute the mac_ise_collection.py script which does:
        - Asks the user for the ISE hostname or IP address and user/password (ssh)
        - Connect to the server and find the deployment info
        - Ask the user for which nodes to collect data from.  For each node selected:
            - Connect via SSH
            - Collect a "show tech-support" and upload it to the CX Drive (CXD)
            - Configure a "repository" on the ISE node (sftp to cxd.cisco.com)
            - Collect a diagnostic bundle and upload it to the CX Drive (CXD)

```zsh

Example Output:

Welcome to the Cisco First Responder installer for MacOS.

This script will download and install a local copy of python3
in your home directory and then install the necessary dependencies
in a virtualenv.

Then it will execute a python script that will connect to ISE and run a collection script.

The script will be installed in ~/.cisco_firstresponder/ and can be easily removed by deleting that directory.
Do you want to continue (Y/n)? y

Fetch python from python.org and install in ~/.cisco_firstresponder/

    Welcome to the CX-FirstResponder ISE TAC Log Backup Tool.

    This tool will walk you through the process of backing up the logs from your ISE node and uploading
    them to the TAC Case for analysis.

    It will go through the following steps:
    1 - Connect to your ISE node via SSH
    2 - Find the nodes in your deployment
    3 - Ask you which nodes to collect diagnostics from
    4 - For each of the selected nodes, it will in parallel:
        a - Validate that the ISE node has connectivity the Cisco SFTP server
        b - Validate the SFTP server's SSH fingerprint to make sure it will be sending to Cisco's SFTP server
        c - Create a repository on the ISE node to store the logs called TAC-<TAC Case Number>
        d - Create a "show tech-support"
        e - Upload it to the TAC Case
        f - Create a "support diagnostic bundle"
        g - Upload it to the TAC Case
        h - Remove the repository from the ISE node

    The process of collecting diagnostics from your ISE node can take up to 45 minutes per node.  Please be patient.

Please enter the hostname or IP address of the ISE node: 172.18.124.20
